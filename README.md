## External User’s Goal

## Structure
Balsamiq wireframes was used as a tool for meticulously planning out the mobile and desktop layout of a project. With its intuitive interface and wide array of pre-designed components, ideas were swiftly sketched out and visualized. By creating wireframes for both mobile and desktop layouts, teams can ensure a cohesive and user-friendly design across various screen sizes and devices. Balsamiq's simplicity enables quick iterations, allowing stakeholders to provide feedback early in the design process and iterate rapidly. Moreover, the low-fidelity nature of Balsamiq wireframes encourages a focus on functionality and user flow rather than intricate design details, fostering efficient communication and collaboration among team members. Overall, leveraging Balsamiq wireframes streamlines the design process, fosters collaboration, and ultimately leads to the creation of more polished and user-centric digital experiences.
