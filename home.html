            <!-- Welcome -->
            <p>Welcome aboard <span class="username"></span>, we're thrilled to have you join us on this
                journey of exploration and discovery. As you step into this virtual space, you're about
                to embark on a remarkable adventure to uncover if you possess the qualities and determination
                required to reach for the stars. Whether you're a seasoned space enthusiast or just beginning to dream
                of the cosmos, prepare to be inspired and tested like never before. Let the adventure begin!</p>

            <h2 id="facts">A small fish in a big pond...</h2>
            <p>The universe's scale is mind-boggling, stretching far beyond human comprehension. Galaxies, each with
                billions to trillions of stars, float like islands in an endless cosmic sea. Yet, they're mere specks in
                space's grand tapestry. The observable universe spans 93 billion light-years in diameter, with light
                from its farthest reaches taking billions of years to reach us. And this observable universe is just a
                fraction of the entire cosmos, possibly extending beyond perception. If that doesn't blow your mind
                <span class="username"></span>, check out these awesome facts below!</p>

            <h2 id="history">A brief history of humans and space</h2>
            <p>The human history of space exploration is a tale of ambition and innovation that began with
                visionaries like Konstantin Tsiolkovsky and Robert H. Goddard laying the groundwork for rocketry in
                the early 20th century. The Space Age officially began with the launch of Sputnik 1 by the Soviet
                Union in 1957, sparking a space race with the United States. Monumental achievements followed,
                including Yuri Gagarin's orbit of the Earth in 1961 and Neil Armstrong's moon landing in 1969. Since
                then, space exploration has evolved into a collaborative effort involving multiple nations and
                agencies. Milestones include the International Space Station, robotic exploration of planets, and
                the ongoing quest to explore Mars. As we look to the future, space exploration continues to inspire
                awe and promise new discoveries.</p>

            <h2 id="fame">Hall of fame</h2>
            <h3>Neil Armstrong</h3>
            <p>Neil Armstrong's historic moon landing on July 20, 1969, stands as a defining moment in human
                history. As commander of NASA's Apollo 11 mission, Armstrong became the first person to set foot on
                the lunar surface, famously uttering the words "That's one small step for man, one giant leap for
                mankind."</p>
            <h3>Laikia</h3>
            <p>Laika was a Soviet space dog aboard the spacecraft Sputnik 2, which was launched by the Soviet Union
                on November 3, 1957. Laika's journey marked the first time a living being was sent into orbit around
                the Earth. Tragically, Laika did not survive the mission, as the technology to safely return animals
                from space had not yet been developed at that time.</p>
            <h3>Valentina Tereshkova</h3>
            <p>Valentina Tereshkova, a Soviet cosmonaut, made history on June 16, 1963, as the first woman to fly in
                space. Born in Maslennikovo, Russia, Tereshkova piloted the Vostok 6 spacecraft, orbiting the Earth
                48 times over almost three days. Her mission was a significant milestone in space exploration and a
                testament to the Soviet Union's commitment to gender equality.</p>
            <h3>Chris Hadfield</h3>
            <p>Chris Hadfield became the first Canadian to command the ISS in 2013 during Expedition 35. Hadfield's
                remarkable career as an astronaut, pilot, engineer, and musician
                has made him a beloved figure in the space community and a source of inspiration for millions
                worldwide, demonstrating the power of curiosity, creativity, and perseverance in exploring the
                cosmos.</p>
