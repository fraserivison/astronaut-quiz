      <p class="main-text">The universe's scale is mind-boggling, stretching far beyond human comprehension. Galaxies,
        each with
        billions to trillions of stars, float like islands in an endless cosmic sea. Yet, they're mere specks in
        space's grand tapestry. The observable universe spans 93 billion light-years in diameter, with light
        from its farthest reaches taking billions of years to reach us. And this observable universe is just a
        fraction of the entire cosmos, possibly extending beyond perception. If that doesn't blow your mind

      <br>
      <h2 id="history">A brief history of humans and space</h2>
      <p class="main-text">The human history of space exploration is a tale of ambition and innovation that began with
        visionaries like Konstantin Tsiolkovsky and Robert H. Goddard laying the groundwork for rocketry in
        the early 20th century. The Space Age officially began with the launch of Sputnik 1 by the Soviet
        Union in 1957, sparking a space race with the United States. Monumental achievements followed,
        including Yuri Gagarin's orbit of the Earth in 1961 and Neil Armstrong's moon landing in 1969. Since
        then, space exploration has evolved into a collaborative effort involving multiple nations and
        agencies. Milestones include the International Space Station, robotic exploration of planets, and
        the ongoing quest to explore Mars. As we look to the future, space exploration continues to inspire
        awe and promise new discoveries.</p>

      <h2 id="fame">Hall of Fame</h2>
      <p class="main-text">Throughout history, numerous iconic figures have transcended the confines of Earth's atmosphere, venturing into
        the vast expanse of space. These trailblazers, whose names resonate with the spirit of exploration and human
        achievement, have played pivotal roles in advancing our understanding of the cosmos and inspiring generations to
        dream beyond the stars. Their courage, resilience, and dedication to pushing the boundaries of what is possible
        have left an indelible mark on the annals of space exploration, serving as beacons of hope and inspiration for
        humanity's collective journey into the great unknown.</p>

          <h3>Neil Armstrong</h3>
          <p class="main-text">Neil Armstrong's historic moon landing on July 20, 1969, stands as a defining moment in
            human history. As commander of NASA's Apollo 11 mission, Armstrong became the first person to set foot on
            the lunar surface, famously uttering the words "That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind."

            Soviet Union on November 3, 1957. Laika's journey marked the first time a living being was sent into orbit
            around the Earth. Tragically, Laika did not survive the mission, as the technology to safely return animals
            from space had not yet been developed at that time.</p>

            woman to fly in space. Born in Maslennikovo, Russia, Tereshkova piloted the Vostok 6 spacecraft, orbiting
            the Earth 48 times over almost three days. Her mission was a significant milestone in space exploration and
            a testament to the Soviet Union's commitment to gender equality.</p>
