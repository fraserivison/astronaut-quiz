            <p>The universe's scale is mind-boggling, stretching far beyond human comprehension. Galaxies, each with
                billions to trillions of stars, float like islands in an endless cosmic sea. Yet, they're mere specks in
                space's grand tapestry. The observable universe spans 93 billion light-years in diameter, with light
                from its farthest reaches taking billions of years to reach us. And this observable universe is just a
                fraction of the entire cosmos, possibly extending beyond perception. If that doesn't blow your mind
                <span class="username"></span>, check out these awesome facts below!</p>

                  <h2 id="history">A brief history of humans and space</h2>
                  <p>The human history of space exploration is a tale of ambition and innovation that began with
                    visionaries like Konstantin Tsiolkovsky and Robert H. Goddard laying the groundwork for rocketry in
                    the early 20th century. The Space Age officially began with the launch of Sputnik 1 by the Soviet
                    Union in 1957, sparking a space race with the United States. Monumental achievements followed,
                    including Yuri Gagarin's orbit of the Earth in 1961 and Neil Armstrong's moon landing in 1969. Since
                    then, space exploration has evolved into a collaborative effort involving multiple nations and
                    agencies. Milestones include the International Space Station, robotic exploration of planets, and
                    the ongoing quest to explore Mars. As we look to the future, space exploration continues to inspire
                    awe and promise new discoveries.</p>

Laika's journey marked the first time a living being was sent into orbit around the Earth. Tragically, Laika did not survive the mission, as the technology to safely return animals from space had not yet been developed at that time.</p>

Born in Maslennikovo, Russia, Tereshkova piloted the Vostok 6 spacecraft, orbiting the Earth 48 times over almost three days. Her mission was a significant milestone in space exploration and a testament to the Soviet Union's commitment to gender equality.</p>
