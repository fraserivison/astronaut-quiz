                <h2 id="facts">A small fish in a big pond...</h2>
                <p>The scale of the universe is staggering, stretching far beyond the limits of human comprehension.
                    Within its vast expanse, galaxies, each containing billions to trillions of stars, drift like
                    islands in an endless cosmic sea. Yet, even these galaxies are mere specks within the greater
                    tapestry of space. The observable universe spans an astonishing 93 billion light-years in diameter,
                    a distance so vast that light from the most distant reaches takes billions of years to reach us.
                    That is some serious size that we can not even begin to comprehend! And yet, this observable
                    universe is just a tiny fraction of the entire cosmos, which may extend far beyond what we can
                    perceive. If that wasn't enough to blow your mind <span class="user-greeting"></span>, check out
                    these awesome facts below!</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The speed of light is equal to 186,000 miles per second. That means you would need a car that
                        could reach speeds of 669.6 million miles per hour.
                    </li>
                    <li>There is a black hole at the center of our galaxy called Sagittarius A, with a mass equal to 4
                        billion of our Suns. Don't worry, though. It's so far away from Earth that we don't have to
                        worry about getting sucked in.</li>
                    <li>All of the planets in our solar system can fit in between the Earth and the Moon, with about
                        2,729 miles to spare!</li>
                    <li>And in around 4.5 billion years, the Milky Way is expected to collide with the Andromeda galaxy,
                        our closest galactic neighbor, to form a giant elliptical galaxy.</li>
                    <li>If you put your finger over a star in the sky, you are preventing photons that have travelled to
                        Earth undisturbed for millions of years from finally entering your eye.</li>
                    <li>Dark matter is believed to be responsible for 85% of gravity in the universe, and no one knows
                        what it is or how it works.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 id="history">A brief history of humans and space</h2>
                <p>The human history of space exploration is a tale of ambition and innovation that began with
                    visionaries like Konstantin Tsiolkovsky and Robert H. Goddard laying the groundwork for rocketry in
                    the early 20th century. The Space Age officially began with the launch of Sputnik 1 by the Soviet
                    Union in 1957, sparking a space race with the United States. Monumental achievements followed,
                    including Yuri Gagarin's orbit of the Earth in 1961 and Neil Armstrong's moon landing in 1969. Since
                    then, space exploration has evolved into a collaborative effort involving multiple nations and
                    agencies. Milestones include the International Space Station, robotic exploration of planets, and
                    the ongoing quest to explore Mars. As we look to the future, space exploration continues to inspire
                    awe and promise new discoveries.</p>

                <h2 id="fame">Hall of fame</h2>
                <h3>Neil Armstrong</h3>
                <p>Neil Armstrong's historic moon landing on July 20, 1969, stands as a defining moment in human
                    history. As commander of NASA's Apollo 11 mission, Armstrong became the first person to set foot on
                    the lunar surface, famously uttering the words "That's one small step for man, one giant leap for
                    mankind."</p>
                <h3>Laikia</h3>
                <p>Laika was a Soviet space dog aboard the spacecraft Sputnik 2, which was launched by the Soviet Union
                    on November 3, 1957. Laika's journey marked the first time a living being was sent into orbit around
                    the Earth. Tragically, Laika did not survive the mission, as the technology to safely return animals
                    from space had not yet been developed at that time.</p>
                <h3>Valentina Tereshkova</h3>
                <p>Valentina Tereshkova, a Soviet cosmonaut, made history on June 16, 1963, as the first woman to fly in
                    space. Born in Maslennikovo, Russia, Tereshkova piloted the Vostok 6 spacecraft, orbiting the Earth
                    48 times over almost three days. Her mission was a significant milestone in space exploration and a
                    testament to the Soviet Union's commitment to gender equality.</p>
                <h3>Chris Hadfield</h3>
                <p>Chris Hadfield became the first Canadian to command the ISS in 2013 during Expedition 35. Hadfield's
                    remarkable career as an astronaut, pilot, engineer, and musician
                    has made him a beloved figure in the space community and a source of inspiration for millions
                    worldwide, demonstrating the power of curiosity, creativity, and perseverance in exploring the
                    cosmos.</p>
