                <h2>A small fish in a big pond...</h2>
                <p>The scale of the universe is staggering, stretching far beyond the limits of human comprehension.
                    Within its vast expanse, galaxies, each containing billions to trillions of stars, drift like
                    islands in an endless cosmic sea. Yet, even these galaxies are mere specks within the greater
                    tapestry of space. The observable universe spans an astonishing 93 billion light-years in diameter,
                    a distance so vast that light from the most distant reaches takes billions of years to reach us.
                    That is some serious size that we can not even begin to comprehend! And yet, this observable
                    universe is just a tiny fraction of the entire cosmos, which may extend far beyond what we can
                    perceive. If that wasn't enough to blow your mind <span class="user-greeting"></span>, check out
                    these awesome facts below!</p>
